        <h3>WHERE I'VE BEEN</h3>
        <p>
          I am originally from Makawao, HI. I grew up surfing the beaches and
          exploring the jungles of the island of Maui. In my high school years
          my family was relocated to Albuqeruque, NM where I found a passion for
          CAD and engineering systems. For the next ten years I studied and
          worked in high-tech manufacturing, opening more opportunities for
          myself and moving again to Colorado, eventually settling in downtown
          Louisville. Here I enjoy every mountain sport there is and living life
          with my friends and family that I've found here.

        <h3>WHAT I'M DOING</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a software engineer, machinist and maker. Fueled by my beliefs
          that aesthetics and user experience are an essential integration to
          everything we make or use, I bring a unique approach to design in
          everything I do. Currently a student at Thinkful, I'm learning the
          skills to create powerful, user-friendly applications for machine and
          server interfaces with limitless applications. My extensive experience
          in manufacturing ensures I will understand the challenges your
          business faces and create a tailor- made solution that will maximize
          your efficiency. It is my personal mission to create tools that push
          businesses to be competitive at the next level, whether its a small
          shop looking to expand or a business of thirty years.

        <h3>WHAT I HOPE TO DO</h3>
        <p>
          Through everything I have and will do, I aspire to be the best
          designer and human being I can be. I hope to use all of my skills and
          experience to contribute to deepening our knowledge of the cosmos,
          using my applications and software to support the aerospace industry
          and all applicable applied sciences. Increasing the level of our
          world's technology means increasing the opportunities and quality of
          life available to everyone and a great deal of these technologies have
          come from the continued development of space exploration programs.
